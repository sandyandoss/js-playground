# JavaScript Playground

Welcome to my magical JavaScript Playground — where semicolons, curly braces, and console logs come to life!

This repo is my learning journey as I explore the world of JavaScript through Codecademy (and caffeine).  
It’s messy sometimes, but so is art — and every line of code here is a step toward becoming the developer I dream to be.

Expect to find:
- Little experiments that went right (and wrong)
- Projects that talk back (thanks, console.log)
- Code that I don’t remember writing at 2 AM
- My victories, bugs, and probably some snack crumbs

Stay tuned — the best is yet to be debugged.
